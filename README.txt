GENERAL NOTES
=============

Game data and patching:
-----------------------

This source release does not contain any game data, the game data is still
covered by the original EULA and must be obeyed as usual.

You must patch the game to the latest version.

Note that Doom 3 and Doom 3: Resurrection of Evil are available from the Steam store at
http://store.steampowered.com/app/9050/
http://store.steampowered.com/app/9070/

Other platforms, updated source code, security issues:
------------------------------------------------------

If you have obtained this source code several weeks after the time of release,
it is likely that you can find modified and improved
versions of the engine in various open source projects across the internet.
Depending what is your interest with the source code, those may be a better
starting point.

Compiling on win32:
-------------------

A project file for Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 is provided in neo\doom.sln
We expect the solution file is compatible with the Express releases

You will need the Microsoft DirectX SDK installed as well.
If it does not reside in "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft DirectX SDK (June 2010)"
you will need to update the project files accordingly.

Back End Rendering of Stencil Shadows:
--------------------------------------

The Doom 3 GPL source code release does not include functionality enabling rendering
of stencil shadows via the “depth fail” method, a functionality commonly known as 
"Carmack's Reverse".

MayaImport:
---------------------------

The code for our Maya export plugin is included, if you are a Maya licensee
you can obtain the SDK from Autodesk.

Copyright (C) 1991-1995, Thomas G. Lane

Permission is hereby granted to use, copy, modify, and distribute this
software (or portions thereof) for any purpose, without fee, subject to these
conditions:
(1) If any part of the source code for this software is distributed, then this
README file must be included, with this copyright and no-warranty notice
unaltered; and any additions, deletions, or changes to the original files
must be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation.
(2) If only executable code is distributed, then the accompanying
documentation must state that "this software is based in part on the work of
the Independent JPEG Group".
(3) Permission for use of this software is granted only if the user accepts
full responsibility for any undesirable consequences; the authors accept
NO LIABILITY for damages of any kind.

These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the IJG code,
not just to the unmodified library.  If you use our work, you ought to
acknowledge us.

NOTE: unfortunately the README that came with our copy of the library has
been lost, so the one from release 6b is included instead. There are a few
'glue type' modifications to the library to make it easier to use from
the engine, but otherwise the dependency can be easily cleaned up to a
better release of the library.
